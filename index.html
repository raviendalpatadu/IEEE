        <h1>What is RevolUX?</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          RevolUX is an Inter University UI/UX Designathon organized by AIESEC
          in University of Colombo together with IEEE Student Branch of
          University of Colombo School of Computing. We are proud to bring this
          event for the second time in a row with the goal of providing
          undergraduates with hands on experience in User Interface and User
          Experience designing. This event would open doors to get exposed to
          design-related fields that helps to enhance the skills of
          undergraduates and make themselves ready to step to the world of work
          with confidence.
